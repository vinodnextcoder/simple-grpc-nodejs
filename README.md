## Simple nodejs gRPC


- First, you'll need to install the required dependencies:

```sh
git clone
cd simple-grpc-nodejs
npm i
```
- Then, let's create a gRPC service definition in example.proto:
- Next, let's create a server that implements the Greeter service:
- Finally, let's create a client that calls the SayHello method on the server:

That's it! This is a very basic example of gRPC in Node.js. For more advanced usage, you can refer to the official gRPC documentation:

## To run 

First bash or terminal

```sh
node ./greeter.js
```

Second bash or terminal
```sh
node ./SayHello.js
```
